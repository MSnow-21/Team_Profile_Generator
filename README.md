Project Overview: The Team Profile Generator is an application that uses Node.js to initialize prompts to enter team member information. The prompts are completed utilize the NPM inquirer package with object inputs created within Javscript. The Team Profile Generator allows a user to input the employees on the team. The employees are a Manager, a Engineer, and a Intern. Employee inputs are generated using a Class for the Employee and extended to the other team members. After a manager for the team is entered the user has the ability to move to the next team member or end the application. Just like a team member was entered, this selection of employees is completed through a list selection within the terminal. When a user ends the program the HTML that was created is sent to the index.html file. Opening the HTML file allows the user to see their team in a clean format of cards with the revelant information in each of those cards. Click on each employees email address to send them an email. Click on the engineers github link to be directed to their github profile.

Entering in a Manager, Engineer, and Intern.
